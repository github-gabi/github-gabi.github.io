                            <p class="articleFirst-p">While the life of painter, sculptor, and poet Osvaldo Sánchez Terrazas was marked by his personal commitment to artistic expression,
                            an art competition at his estate in Tarata recently memorialized his artistic accomplishments by bringing together 50 artists
                            from Bolivia, Peru, and Sweden. The contest was designed by his wife and children with the intent of promoting artistic expression
                            and intercultural practices. </p>
                            <p>“The purpose is to generate a space … so that all painters of Bolivia can share their art, paint,
                            and experiences,” says Walter Sánchez, son of Osvaldo and one of the organizers of the contest. The competition consisted
                            of two separate works by the participating artists. One work was an in-process painting created on the spot in the area of
                            Villa Recreo and Tarata. The second was a work previously created and exhibited between the dates of February 3rd and 5th,
                            2017. “The work in Villa Recreo was a vital experience for the artists,” says Walter. Most participants in the contest were
                            from Cochabamba, though other cities such as La Paz and Santa Cruz were well represented. Among the notable artists registered
                            were Remy Daza Rojas, Sansuste Zapata, Rosmery Mamani Ventura, Ramiro Baptista Revilla, and Vidal Cusi. “The number of artists
                            surpassed expectations,” reflected Walter, “A maximum of 30 high-level artists from all over Bolivia were expected. However,
                            there were 50 participants even from abroad. The masters, but also the new generations with new aesthetics and techniques.”</p>

                            <p>The jury was comprised of three well established artists: Juan Terrazas, Fernando Ugalde, and Renato Estrada and two family
                            members (Enriqueta Canedo Vda., and Walter Sánchez Canedo). “I was most impressed with the high quality of the painters and
                            their professionalism,” states Walter. “The contest involved two paintings. The objective of this modality was to appreciate the sensitivity, the technique, the ability of the artists to capture the aesthetic of their surroundings, whether
                            landscape, social, architectural, etc. In this sense, works of great quality were painted.”</p>

                            <p> The winner of this year’s contest
                            was Rosemary Mamani of La Paz for a work titled “A corner of Don Osvaldo.” The work is a mixed medium painting portraying
                            a sink in an entrance in Villa Recreo and was created between February 3rd and 4th. “What struck me about the work is that
                            there is no embellishment or ostentatious presentation. No metaphor. The forms of the objects are clear. It does not give
                            rise to any confusion,” explained Walter when asked about what differentiated the winning piece from the others. “It stands
                            out for its minimal character, a language deployed from the 1960s and 1970s by American artists like Andy Warhol, Tom Wasselman
                            and others - and now has its return.” With the success of this first competition, organizers are committed making it an annual
                            event.</p>
                            <p> “As the competition exceeded expectations, I am sure that next year there will be more participants,” said Walter.
                            “Having a contest’s location such as in a residence and in a space for sharing, I think that it is important that international
                            artists be able to participate,” said Walter regarding the importance of expanding the competition to include a broad mix
                            of Bolivian and foreign artists. “It would be a great opportunity … for our local painters to be nourished by new sensitivities,
                            new pictorial languages, and so on. Art is essentially the possibility of not only expressing on canvas or on a medium, but
                            also linking with the vitality of life. International artists will be welcome,”</p>

                        <p class="lead-article mt-3 mb-5 text-muted">If you are the one who enjoys adventures, beautiful landscapes, and wild experiences, you will like Toro Toro. It is difficult
                        to say what is the most incredible thing in the Toro Toro National Park. Maybe it is the way to be a tourist, which is an
                        adventure tourist. Toro Toro is not a place with many facilities, and the activities are risky and require specialized skills
                        and physical exertion. Nothing is built for tourists, even though it is a really touristic place. It is an active itinerary;
                        you are really meeting nature because of the difficult walking and jumping from one stone to another. That is a big experience
                        not only for geology and natural history lovers, but also for those who want to step off the well-trodden path to discover
                        an extraordinary place totally off the beaten track in Bolivia. It is perfect for those looking to explore a more hidden
                        part of Bolivia and visit one of the country’s most scenic and exciting national parks before the crowds get there.</p>

                        <p class="articleFirst-p">Incredible waterfalls, a large cave with stalactites and stalagmites, some of the best preserved dinosaur tracks in South
                        America, and a “city of rocks” are among other attractions you can experience in the stunning Toro Toro National Park. At
                        the waterfall site, it is possible to bathe just like a under natural shower. It is so beautiful to watch!</p>
                        <p> The cave called
                        Humajalanta is an adventure; it is 4,600 meters long and 164 meters deep. It is filled with stalactites and stalagmites from
                        the Cretaceous period and they are well preserved, but you should not fear the dark! When you turn off your flashlight it
                        is totally dark inside and you can see nothing. Also, you better not have claustrophobia; you have to crawl through small
                        holes between stones. The cave also has waterfalls, which can be heard and seen with a powerful beam of light. The dinosaur
                        footprints can be found in several locations. There are more than 2,500 footprints from different kinds of dinosaurs (biped
                        and quadruped dinosaurs, theropods and sauropods); the largest footprint is one meter across. It is amazing how clear you
                        can still see it, even though it is 145 million years old.</p>

                         <p>The “city” made of stone is indeed an incredible experience. You will hike for some hours and see stones looking like animals
                        such as an elephant, a turtle, and a fish. Additionally, you will see wall paintings on the rocks, which are millions of
                        years old. That was the way you communicated with each other in the time before there was an alphabet.</p>
                        <p>The paintings are
                        drawn with animal blood and color from plants and it are just like a tattoo: they will never disappear. On a tour to Toro
                        Toro, you will visit breathtaking views and explore fascinating, memorable, and unique natural attractions. It is very challenging
                        for adventure lovers and is well worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>The park also offers scrubby woodland with wildlife flocks of parakeets.
                        It has lush and tropical vegetation with many different sorts of plants and animals. For example, if you are lucky, you will
                        see the only species of endangered red-fronted rainbow macaws found in South America. The park is an extraordinarily authentic
                        paradise with deep canyons and valleys. Panoramic landscapes eroded by wind and waters make it even more extraordinary.</p>

                        <p>Small charming houses, buildings, hotels, museums, and narrow streets made of stones make up the small town. The town itself
                        has a small area with shops and places to eat; however, there are no pharmacies and no internet cafés and that makes it somewhat
                        primitive.</p>
                        <p>Toro Toro has a population of 10,700. Almost everybody knows each other and everybody is really kind and open
                        minded, it makes for a good atmosphere. In Toro Toro the language is not only Spanish, but Quechua as well as the culture.
                        The Quechua people are the indigenous peoples of South America who speak any of the Quechua languages. The women wear colorful
                        traditional clothes and both men and women wear bowler style hats.</p>
                        <p>Toro Toro is an ancient town in Bolivia founded about
                        250 years ago. Next to the town is Toro Toro National Park, which was founded in 1989. The park covers an area of 164 square
                        kilometers. It is situated in the northern Potosí department, 140 kilometers south of Cochabamba. You can only come to Toro
                        Toro from Cochabamba. There are buses that travel from Cochabamba to Toro Toro and viceversa. The roads are mainly old cobblestone
                        ones most of the way but well worth the travel. In travel books about Bolivia, you will found more information as how to
                        get there and what to do and so on. Maybe the book will recommend an agency you can use to get transportation, lodging, and
                        a guided tour.</p>

                        <p class="lead-article mt-3 mb-5 text-muted">Mother’s Day can be one of the
                            most beautiful days or a painful
                            reminder of a missing piece of your
                            life. This day is being celebrated
                            by people all over the world, but
                            in Bolivia it is more special than
                            anywhere else. Not only because
                            a woman is the most important
                            person in a home, but also because
                            of the history of the 27th of May,
                            which has been one of the most
                            important</p>

                        <p class="articleFirst-p">For some mothers, Mother’s Day is the best day of
                            their lives. For mothers in Europe with young children,
                            Mother’s Day is most of the time over after five minutes
                            after they gave their presents. Then it is just like every day,
                            Children’s Day! On Mother’s Day, we pay homage to the
                            one who gave us life. The woman is the most important
                            person in a home, especially in Bolivia. She is the one who is
                            in charge of the household economy and the support of the
                            entire household. The women from this unique day in May
                            in Bolivia are “The Heroines of the Hill.” Allow me to explain
                            this special story.</p>
                        <h3>Women fighting for freedom</h3>
                        <p>May 27th, 1812 was the first time women participated in battle. In 1812, Latin
                            America was fighting for independence from Spain. The king of Spain sent
                            general Goyeneche to the valleys of Cochabamba. While the men were dying in
                            a bloody battle, the women decided to defend their community by themselves.
                            Under the orders of Josefa Manuela Gandarillas (who was elderly and blind), an
                            army was formed. The army consisted only of women, children, and elders. They
                            were armed with small weapons such as saucepans and sticks. They climbed the
                            Coronilla (San Sebastián Hill) with the belief “Our home is sacred,” carrying the
                            image of the Virgin of Mercy. On May 27th, 1812, a day we will never forget,
                            the inevitable happened. General Goyeneche and his army slaughtered hundreds
                            of women. There was plenty of pain in the community, but through this pain
                            grew new hope. The women who were killed, are now known as “Heroinas de
                            la Coronilla” or “Heroines of the Hill.” Every year, millions of Bolivians celebrate
                            Mother’s Day on this date, remembering these heroic women. Today, their lives
                            and the battle they lost are remembered as one of the most special days of the
                            year. There is always a big party during Mother’s Day.</p>
                        <h3>Way of celebrating in Bolivia</h3>
                        <p>Typically in Bolivia, children from elementary schools invite their mothers to their
                            schools. At school, the children show their mothers what they have learned, such
                            as some typical Bolivian dances or tender songs. The children have been practicing
                            for a month to do this performance, so everything is done with pure happiness
                            and delight. It is a very special day for the mothers and their children. Not only
                            because they can show their mothers their beautiful dances, but also because of
                            the special meaning of this day as I mentioned previously. Almost every mother
                            celebrates Mother’s Day at the same way.</p>
                        <h3>Special day for every mother in the world</h3>
                        <p>For mothers all around the world this day is very special. Only Bolivia celebrates
                            Mother’s Day on the 27th but it is a big party everywhere.</p>
                         <p><i>“I really like to be aware of the great relationship I have with my kids once a year.
                            I am very grateful. The most beautiful presents for Mother’s Day were when my
                            kids were little. They gave my self-made crafts. I still kept everything somewhere.”</i>
                            (The Netherlands) Another reaction is: “We always celebrate Mother’s Day with
                            presents, breakfast in bed, and we are also going to the grandmothers, because
                            they are mothers, too.” (The United States). “In Bolivia, they celebrate this day
                            with a lot of joy in schools. Mother’s Day is a very happy day for me. I am always
                            going to the school of the children, were they are showing me dances. My
                            husband buys always some presents and he and my kids make breakfast for me.
                            We are also always going to my mother to celebrate.”(Bolivia)</p>
                        <p>In the United States, Mother’s Day is a big event. Phone lines have heavy traffic
                            during this day and there is a peak in restaurants. Traditions in the United States
                            include breakfast in bed, giving flowers or other gifts. In France, people celebrate
                            this day on the last Sunday of the month of May. The mother is mostly being
                            honored with a cake that looks like a bouquet of flowers. In India, Mother’s Day is a big hype. It has been commercialized to a great extent. Big companies launch
                            women oriented products. Also the media creates a big hype about this day with
                            special television programs and features. Unlike other countries, Spain celebrates
                            Mother’s Day in December. The Spaniards pay not only tribute to their own
                            mothers, but also to Virgin Mary. So Mother’s Day is in general in Spain a religious
                            celebration. In England, the people already celebrated Mother’s Day in the 17th
                            century. This country was the first one to dedicate a day especially for mothers. In
                            the United Kingdom, there is the tradition to make a rich almond cake for mothers
                            called “Mothering Cake”’ or “Simnel Cake.”</p>

                                celebrate Mother’s Day and why on May 27th. I think it is very special to honor
                                our mothers on the day when hundreds of women died and gave their lives. Every
                                country has a special reason to honor mothers on this beautiful day.</p>

                        <p class="lead-article mt-3 mb-5 text-muted">If you played a word association game with the average person and said
                            the word “Amazon Rainforest,” chances are you would hear the word
                            “Brazil” long before hearing the word “Bolivia.” Bolivia, however, has its
                            own little piece of Amazon basin beauty and it can be experienced for a
                            much lower price than a rainforest tour in its Brazilian counterpart.</p>

                        <p class="articleFirst-p">While Brazil generally gets
                            the headlines, the Amazon
                            Basin actually spans nine
                            different South American countries.
                            With a footprint this large, it is hardly
                            a surprise that many lesser known
                            countries also offer the Amazon
                            experience and, generally, for less
                            money. Bolivia is particularly blessed in
                            that its basin area has both traditional
                            rainforest as well as wetland savannah
                            which affords spectacular wildlife
                            viewing during most times of the year.</p>

                            <p>The jumping off point for many
                            tours of the Amazon is the small
                            town of Rurrenabaque. Service to
                            Rurrenabaque is provided by both
                            Eco-Jet and Amazonas airlines for
                            about 1,400 bolivianos, though
                            TAM offers flights on Wednesdays
                            and Fridays for about 900 bolivianos
                            round-trip. Unfortunately for
                            Cochabambinos, there is no direct
                            service to Rurrenenabaque and it is
                            generally only accessible by way of
                            a connecting flight through La Paz.
                            Despite the inconvenience, the overall
                            price is fairly reasonable and a room
                            can generally be found in town for 35 -
                            70 bolivianos.</p>
                            <p>After doing a little research online
                            for my tour of the Amazon, I chose
                            to visit the “pampas” or wetland
                            savannah area of the Amazon Basin.
                            Most tour companies operating out of
                            Rurrernabaque offer a three-day, twotwo-
                            night, all-inclusive package which
                            offers accommodations in either a
                            jungle or riverside lodge setting. These
                            packages range from 1,200-2,000
                            bolivianos, which is usually indicative of
                            the number of amenities and activities
                            offered by the agency.</p>
                            <p>Upon my arrival at the Rurrenabaque
                            airport, I was greeted by a taxi driver
                            who immediately asked if I was
                            interested in a tour (many of the
                            agencies work with the taxi drivers to
                            insure a steady stream of clients). I
                            informed him of what I was looking
                            for and my general price range, and
                            within 10 minutes I was brought to an
                            agency, Mashaquipe Cultural Eco-tours,
                            offering tours of both Las Pampas and
                            the rainforest for 1,800 bolivianos.
                            Be prepared to pay a national park
                            entrance fee of 150 bolivianos, making
                            the overall price tag 1,950 bolivianos.</p>
                            <p>My guide, David, helped me load my
                            understuffed backpack into the trunk
                            of his car. “You are the only visitor that
                            we have today. There are not as many
                            animals to see during this time of year
                            because it is very wet,” he said. “You
                            are lucky. You get a private tour.”</p>
                            <p>The lodge was a 2 ½ hour car ride over
                            unimproved roadways which made the
                            distance seem longer than it probably
                            was. While cars are useful in this area
                            of Bolivia, the narrow roads make
                            motorcycles the preferred means of
                            transportation here. I mentioned to
                            David that I could see living in Bolivia
                            and mentioned the prospect of buying
                            a car. “No, you want a motorcycle,”
                            he responded. After arriving at
                            our destination, it was a 10-minute
                            motorized canoe ride to the camp.</p>
                            <p>The camp was a small complex of
                            two-bed sleeping quarters, a bathroom
                            area, a dining hall, and a kitchen area.
                            The camp was very well maintained
                            and the sleeping quarters featured a
                            toilet, sink and shower and were very
                            clean. As we had arrived late in the
                            afternoon, “la cena” (dinner) was
                            served upon my arrival and consisted
                            of chicken, rice, fruits, and a salad.
                            Meals were excellent and prompt in the
                            morning at around 7:30, lunch soon
                            after returning from morning activities,
                            and dinner around 7 to 7:30PM.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>One of my main rationales for choosing
                            the Las Pampas tour over the Rainforest
                            tour was the prospect of seeing additional wildlife. After dark, David and I cruised the river
                            in search of caimanes, a relative of the crocodile. “You can
                            tell where they are by the yellow reflection off of their eyes,”
                            he said. After about30 minutes of flashlight scanning of the
                            river in our canoe, we found our target – a black caiman. He
                            was nestled under a patch of tree-cover extending over the
                            river. To my astonishment, we were able to draw the canoe
                            incredibly close, practically on top of the reptile without it
                            moving. “He is resting right now,” David said.</p>
                            <p>Upon returning from our late night expedition, I settled in for
                            bed. Sleeping quarters are provided with mosquito netting,
                            though my room seemed relatively free of them despite the
                            precaution. Though mosquitoes are prevalent during the
                            wet season, Las Pampas is relatively free of mosquito-borne
                            illnesses such as Malaria and Dengue. While not dangerous,
                            the mosquitos are extremely annoying and a strong insect
                            repellent is suggested to keep them at bay.</p>
                            <p>As with most quality tour companies, Mashaquipe offered
                            plenty of activities during the three-day, two-night tour.
                            During my stay, I was treated to river tours, a swim with
                            fresh-water dolphins, piranha fishing, and horseback
                            riding. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly, the
                            accommodations to be clean and well-maintained, and the
                            food to be excellent.</p>
                            <p>With my Amazonas flight leaving at 6:20PM, we departed
                            for Rurrenabaque at 1:30PM after a final, big lunch where
                            I met a pair of fellow travelers from England. They had just
                            returned from the jungle tour and, though they said they
                            had not seen much wildlife, they were expressly delighted
                            with their experience. It was a three-hour trip back to town
                            (stopping for refreshments along the way) with an agencysponsored
                            taxi giving a ride back to the airport.</p>
                            <p>All told, my experience in Las Pampas was an exceptional
                            journey to see an area of the planet that everyone should
                            see given the opportunity. As I discovered, Bolivia offers an
                            excellent chance to see these natural wonders without going
                            broke in the process and I would recommend the experience
                            to anyone with the time and a few extra bolivianos in their
                            wallet.</p>
